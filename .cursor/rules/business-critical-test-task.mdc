Business Critical Integration Testing setup for SDKs in general.


The idea of this project is to have the SDK fort intact. This project will introduce Integration Test to Iterable SDK.

The project will have end to end integration test established with Iterable Backend. It means there will be a project created in production with API key which the test suite will use. Below we can discuss the feature and its test case and what all is needed for it. 

1. Integration Test Setup
Have the setup ready for integration tests
Iterable Project Setup
Run the app/test project locally
- Android Integration Test app setup should be complete
- It should have essential pages.
- Ability to test setup is done by triggering a campaign and making sure it works. 
- A page for each module - In App, Push Notification, Embedded Messages and Deep linking which can be navigated from home screen. 

Move to next task only if this task is done done.

2.  InApp messages test

Implement integration test to verify:
Silent push works
Confirm In App is displayed
Track In App Open metric are validated
Confirm In App is able to Deep link
Handlers are called and app navigated to certain module

Move to next tasks only if this task is done done.

3. Push Notification
Implement Integration Test to verify:
Push notification configuration on iOS and Android platform
Device receives push notification
Device has permission granted to show notification
CI uses backend server keys to send notification.
Push notification is displayed
Push delivery metrics are captured
Tapping on Push notification leads to trackPush opens
Tapping on buttons with deep link invokes SDK handlers.



4.  Embedded messages
Implement Integration test to verify:
Project to have eligibility and user list ready
Receive eligible message for signed in user
Embedded messages are displayed
Embedded metrics are verified
Deep linking works

Things to consider -
Silent push flow check
User becomes ineligible to eligible > backend triggers push > and flow continues
User profile details. On a button click / toggle between values > which should match the criteria> And after affirmation of embedded messages toggle it back to default value.

5. Deep linking
Implement Integration to verify:
SMS/Email Flow. Launch the app with the url.
Project setting to have tracking and destination domain
Associated domains setup > iOS
Launch the app with certain link.
Intent filters set on Android | Assetlinks configuration on iOS | Android App Links | iOS Universal Links
Deep linking handler is invoked.


We will start from top to bottom.
