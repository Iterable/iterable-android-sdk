# Beta Mobile SDK Terms of Service

The following terms of service apply to beta versions of the Iterable
iOS and Android SDKs:

Beta versions of Iterableâ€™s iOS and Android SDKs should be used only for
internal testing in a sandbox environment. Beta SDKs should not be used in
production. Iterable may change, fix bugs or vulnerabilities in, remove
features from, add features to, or otherwise improve or modify beta SDKs
before removing their beta designation. Beta SDKs are provided "as is," and
Iterable does not guarantee their functionality or provide support for their
use in production.

Iterable attempts to move beta SDKs out of beta (to general availability)
four weeks after the start of the beta period. However, this timeline is not
guaranteed
